# Movie-Recommendation-System
A Movie Recommendation System is a software application designed to suggest movies to users based on various criteria such as user preferences, viewing history, and movie characteristics. This system can enhance user experience by providing personalized recommendations, thereby increasing user engagement and satisfaction.The Algorithms used in this project are Collaborative Filtering , Content-Based Filtering and Hybrid System.For Evaluation purposes metrices such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Precision, Recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's performance.Perform cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness.The libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Surprise (for collaborative filtering)have been used in this project with the Visualization Tools such as Matplotlib, Seaborn for analyzing and visualizing data. And Deploying the best-performing model to a web application.
